How to play:
There's a circle which moves along a smooth path.
You have to control a (smaller circle)dot using a analog direction pad on the game screen.
You have to keep the dot inside the circle to stay alive.
There are bonus tokens you can earn by tapping on them, but remember to stay inside the bigger circle!!
More challenging than survival circle 1!!
